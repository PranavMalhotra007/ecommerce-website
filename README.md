This is a fully functional frontend-only eCommerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a dynamic product catalog, interactive UI elements,
a shopping cart system, and a responsive design. Users can browse various products, add them to the cart, view product details, and proceed to checkout (UI only, 
no backend integration). JavaScript handles cart functionality, DOM manipulation, and basic form validation. The site is mobile-responsive and styled using modern 
CSS techniques, including Flexbox and Grid.
